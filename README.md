Developed a mathematical model and simulation for a quadcopter's vertical motion and orientation using Octave. Implemented Euler and modified Euler methods to solve differential equations describing the system's dynamics. Designed a closed-loop control system with proportional-derivative control to achieve desired position and orientation, and analyzed stability and system response through graphical visualization.
